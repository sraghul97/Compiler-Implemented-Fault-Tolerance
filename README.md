# Compiler-Implemented-Fault-Tolerance

Compiler Implemented Fault Tolerance for Faults Originating in Hardware


This repo focuses on enhancing the robustness of compiled code through integrated fault tolerance mechanisms in the compiler. By applying code replication and error detection techniques during the compilation process, the aim is to produce software resilient to runtime faults and soft errors.

Key Components:
1. Code Replication: Implementing strategies to replicate code segments, allowing for detection and recovery from faults.
2. Error Detection: Incorporating mechanisms to identify and handle errors that occur during execution.
3. Fault Tolerance Techniques: Exploring various approaches, including redundancy and error-checking, to improve software reliability.
4. Compiler Modifications: Modifying the compiler to insert fault tolerance logic into the generated code, ensuring effective error tolerance and recovery.

Features:
1. Fault tolerance mechanisms are integrated into the compilerâ€™s code generation phase.
2. Provides options for customizing the level and type of fault tolerance applied.
3. Includes test cases and benchmarks to evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented mechanisms.
